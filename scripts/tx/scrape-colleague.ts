/**
 * Texas — Colleague Self-Service scrape (2 colleges)
 *
 * Calls the shared template at scripts/lib/scrape-colleague.ts for the
 * two TX community colleges discovered to run Ellucian Colleague behind
 * a separate self-service subdomain (the auto-add-state fingerprint
 * sweep only probed the colleges' primary domains and missed these):
 *
 *   amarillo-college  → acselfservice.actx.edu/Student/Courses
 *   odessa-college    → sserv.odessa.edu/Student/Courses
 *
 * Closes 2 of the 3 remaining colleges from issue #456 cluster #8
 * (TX shared form: Amarillo, Kilgore, Odessa — HCC already covered by
 * PR #460). Kilgore runs Jenzabar ICS at accesskc.kilgore.edu via a
 * non-standard AddDrop_Courses.jnz portlet URL — saved for a follow-up.
