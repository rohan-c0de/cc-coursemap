/**
 * Alabama Community College System (ACCS) — shared Banner 8 scraper
 *
 * Most ACCS colleges expose course data on a shared Banner 8 host at
 *   https://ssb-prod.ec.accs.edu/PROD/<CODE>/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched
 * where <CODE> is a per-college 3–6 char identifier (CVCC, JSCC, etc.).
 *
 * Origin: 6 AL colleges already have committed course data in
 * data/al/courses/ (apparently from a one-off scrape pre-PR #292) but
 * no scraper file lived in scripts/al/ and the state config has
 * `// manual-only: courses — Phase 2 not yet wired up`. This PR fills
 * that gap with a single shared scraper covering as many ACCS colleges
 * as we have confirmed codes for, and wires it into cron.
 *
 * Wraps scripts/lib/scrape-banner-8.ts (the same template FL #454 uses
 * for fgc + cfk). Each (slug, baseUrl) entry in HOSTS maps to one
 * college. baseUrl = "https://ssb-prod.ec.accs.edu/PROD/<CODE>" — the
 * template appends the bwckschd / bwckctlg paths.
 *
 * Confirmed codes (probed against the host's bwckschd endpoint):
