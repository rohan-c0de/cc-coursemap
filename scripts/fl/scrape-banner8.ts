/**
 * scrape-banner8.ts
 *
 * Florida Banner 8 (legacy "classic" Banner) scraper. Covers the two FCS
 * colleges that run on Banner 8 instead of Banner SSB 9:
 *   - fgc — Florida Gateway College  (https://my.fgc.edu/PROD)
 *   - cfk — The College of the Florida Keys (https://secure.cfk.edu/prod)
 *
 * Thin wrapper around the shared template at scripts/lib/scrape-banner-8.ts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/fl/scrape-banner8.ts             # both colleges
 *   npx tsx scripts/fl/scrape-banner8.ts --college fgc
 *   npx tsx scripts/fl/scrape-banner8.ts --no-import
