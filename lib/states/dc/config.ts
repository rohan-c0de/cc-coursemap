  // DC has no in-state CC→4yr articulation pipeline at all. UDC publishes
  // four articulation PDFs (all to MD/VA schools, dropped by the in-state
  // rule), and the Consortium of Universities arrangement is cross-
  // registration, not course-equivalency. UDC's 1,453 CollegeTransfer.Net
  // entries target zero DC institutions. The dc-transfers cron job was
  // therefore removed from `scrapers` below in 2026-05; if a structured
  // in-state source ever appears, re-add the cron entry and flip this
  // back to true. The scraper script `scripts/dc/scrape-transfer.ts` is
  // retained for manual use.
