// manual-only: NJ has a transfer scraper (scripts/nj/scrape-transfer.ts from NJTransfer.org)
// but no public-accessible course-scheduling system — Colleague Self-Service is auth-gated
// at most NJ colleges. No prereq coverage yet. Revisit once a course scraper is viable.

// NJ community colleges predominantly use Ellucian Colleague Self-Service
// for course scheduling. The public Self-Service JSON REST API endpoints
// vary by college but follow a common URL pattern:
//   https://<host>/Student/Courses/Search
//
// Transfer equivalency data is centralized at NJTransfer.org, a state-mandated
// CGI database maintained by the NJ Transfer consortium. This is the primary
// source for CC-to-university transfer mappings.
//
// The 18 community colleges are coordinated by the New Jersey Council of
// County Colleges (NJCCC). Some former independent colleges have merged
// under the Rowan College umbrella but retain separate campuses and codes.
