// CUNY Global Class Search is a single public search endpoint that covers all
// 26 CUNY institutions (senior + community). v1 scrapes only the 7 community
// colleges; SUNY community colleges (30) remain a separate Phase 2 target and
// will be added to this same "ny" state slug when implemented.
//
// The scraper uses https://globalsearch.cuny.edu/CFGlobalSearchTool/ — a
// JSP/ColdFusion wrapper around CUNYfirst (PeopleSoft Campus Solutions) that
// returns HTML. Per-college registrar pages below are fallbacks for linking
// users to official course listings. CFSearchToolController accepts Base64-
// encoded params (CRN, term, institution) but requires a server-side session
// (JSESSIONID cookie) — without it the params are ignored and the search form
// is returned. Deep-linking is therefore not possible via a static URL.
