/**
 * Look up answers for a classified query. Returns the primary answer
 * always, and a secondary answer when the classifier identified a second
 * intent. The two lookups run in parallel.
 *
 * In addition to the LLM-extracted secondary intent, we synthesize a
 * pathway secondary when the primary is a bare-word course intent
 * ("biology", "data science"). The classifier reasonably routes these
 * to `course`, but the student often also wants degree info — so we run
 * pathway alongside and surface both cards. Same heuristic gates the
 * `unknown`-branch fallback in `lookupUnknown`. See #266.
 *
 * Secondary answers that are NoAnswer with `intent-not-supported` (course
 * intent) or `out-of-scope` (unknown) are filtered out — they would render
 * as a confusing empty card with no studentSummary to anchor them. The
 * primary's studentSummary already covers the whole query. Pathway
 * secondaries that resolved to no-data / missing-entity are also filtered:
 * we synthesized them speculatively, an empty result means no signal.
