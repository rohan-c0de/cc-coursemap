# PostToolUse hook: after a `git checkout -b NAME` Bash call completes
# successfully, write NAME into .claude/branch-lock — but only when it's
# SAFE to overwrite the previous lock. "Safe" means the working tree has
# no uncommitted changes to tracked files at the moment the hook runs.
#
# Why the safety check: parallel skills / sessions can run `git checkout
# -b OTHER_BRANCH` in this same workspace. Without the check, that
# parallel checkout would silently overwrite the lock with OTHER_BRANCH,
# and the subsequent commit (still on the *real* current branch, but
# guarded against the new lock) would pass the guard and land on the
# wrong branch. PR #469 (Alamo) hit exactly this and needed a
# cherry-pick rescue.
#
# With the check: if I have uncommitted Alamo work in the tree and some
# parallel session runs `git checkout -b foo`, this hook sees the dirty
# tree, refuses to overwrite the lock, and the next `git commit` aborts
# with the BRANCH GUARD banner — exactly the desired behavior.
#
# Notes:
#   - `git status --porcelain` excludes untracked (?? entries are reported
#     but we filter them out). We only care about M/A/D/R/C — actual
#     changes to tracked files. Untracked files (worktrees, scratch dirs)
#     are normal and shouldn't block.
#   - Only fires on `git checkout -b NAME` (new-branch creation), not on
#     regular `git checkout BRANCH`. The latter is often used to move
#     between branches the user has already chosen; auto-locking those
#     would fight that workflow.
