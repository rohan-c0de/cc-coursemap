name: auto-add-state
description: Add a US state to Community College Path end-to-end — bootstrap files, fingerprint per-college SIS, scrape courses where templates exist, fetch transfers if a state portal is registered, aggregate prereqs, open a PR — autonomously via scripts/lib/add-state.ts. Use this when the user wants to add a new state (e.g. "/auto-add-state ohio", "add Kentucky", "spin up Iowa"). For phase-by-phase manual control over each step instead, use the older `add-new-state` skill.

# auto-add-state

Autonomous version of the manual `add-new-state` skill. The manual one walks
you through 5 phases over 5 PRs; this one runs the entire pipeline via
`scripts/lib/add-state.ts` and ships **one** PR. Designed for the user to
type the command, walk away, and come back to a PR ready to review.

The full pipeline (orchestrated by `scripts/lib/add-state.ts`):
- Phase 1 — bootstrap (`scripts/lib/bootstrap-state.ts`)
- Phase 2a — fingerprint per college (`scripts/lib/fingerprint-college.ts`)
- Phase 2b — course scraping via the right template
  (`scripts/lib/scrape-{banner-ssb,colleague,banner-8}.ts`)
- Phase 3 — articulation lookup (`data/articulation-portals.json`)
- Phase 4 — prereq aggregation (`scripts/lib/aggregate-prereqs.ts`)
- Phase 5 — Scorecard ingest (`scripts/scorecard-map.ts` + `scripts/ingest-scorecard.ts`).
  Maps each new college to its IPEDS unitid then fetches federal cost / aid /
  completion data into `data/{slug}/scorecard/`. Auto-skips if
  `COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY` is unset.

## Workflow

1. **Parse the slug** from the user's invocation. Lowercase, 2-letter US
   state abbr (e.g. `oh`, `ky`, `ia`, `tx`). If they typed a full name
   ("ohio"), convert. Reject anything that isn't a known state.

2. **Create the branch.** Off `main`:
   ```
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   git checkout -b claude/{slug}-auto-add-state
   ```

3. **Run the orchestrator.** This is the long-running step (typically
   20–60 minutes; OH took 7m for fingerprint + several minutes per scraper
   cohort). Use `Bash` with `run_in_background: true` so the conversation
   doesn't block, then poll for completion:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/lib/add-state.ts --state {slug} --json
   ```
   Save the JSON output to `/tmp/add-state-{slug}-result.json`.

4. **While it runs**, give the user a single status sentence ("Orchestrator
   started for {slug}; I'll be back when it finishes."). Don't poll-narrate
   every minute — let it run.

5. **Read the result JSON** when the subprocess exits. Parse:
   - `bootstrap.collegesDiscovered`
   - `fingerprint.byPlatform` (counts per platform)
   - `courses.bannerSsb.grandTotal` + `courses.colleague.grandTotal` +
     `courses.banner8.grandTotal`
   - `transfers.portal` (or null + `fallbackSuggestion`)
   - `prereqs.aggregated`
   - `scorecard.mapped` / `scorecard.ingested` / `scorecard.ran`
   - `manualTodos[]`

6. **Sanity-check the result.** If `bootstrap.collegesDiscovered === 0`,
   abort: nothing to commit. Tell the user the state probably isn't
   supported by IPEDS sector ∈ {1,4} + cat ∈ {3,4} (rare; e.g. AK has
   only one CC and may need manual handling). Don't commit. Don't push.

7. **Pre-PR feature check** (per `CLAUDE.md`'s three-checks-in-order rule).
   Per Section "Verifying your work" item 1: load `/{slug}/colleges` in
   local dev. Use the preview tools:
   - `preview_start` (dev server reads from `.claude/launch.json`)
   - `preview_eval`: navigate to `http://localhost:3000/{slug}/colleges`
   - `preview_snapshot`: confirm all `bootstrap.collegesDiscovered`
     colleges render, not an empty grid
   - If empty grid: the registry edits didn't apply correctly — abort,
     tell the user, do not commit. Almost always means a regex in
     `bootstrap-state.ts`'s `applyRegistryEdit` matched in the wrong place.

8. **Commit in three logical chunks.** This makes the PR reviewable;
   reviewers can scan Phase 1 (~thousands of lines of generated data),
   Phase 2 (~tens of thousands of lines of scraped course data), and
   Phase 3-4 separately:

   ```
   # Phase 1
   git add data/{slug}/institutions.json data/{slug}/zipcodes.json \
           data/{slug}/transfer-equiv.json lib/states/{slug}/ \
           lib/states/registry.ts lib/institutions.ts lib/geo.ts
   git commit -m "feat: bootstrap {state} — {N} colleges, Phase 1 ($n PR1/8)"

   # Phase 2 (if any course data)
   git add data/{slug}/courses/
   git commit -m "feat: scrape {state} courses — {sections} sections across {N} colleges"

   # Phase 3 + 4 (if any transfer / prereq data)
   git add data/{slug}/prereqs.json
   git commit -m "feat: aggregate {state} prereqs — {N} courses"

   # Phase 5 (if any scorecard data — only when COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY is set)
   git add data/{slug}/scorecard/ data/{slug}/institutions.json data/scorecard-mapping.json
   git commit -m "feat: ingest {state} College Scorecard data — {ingested} colleges"
   ```

   Skip a chunk if its files don't exist (e.g. if every college had a
   custom platform, there's no Phase 2 commit).

9. **Push:**
   ```
   git push -u origin claude/{slug}-auto-add-state
   ```

10. **Open the PR.** Title: `Add {Full State Name} to Community College
    Path (auto-add-state)`. Body: paste the orchestrator's text report
    plus the manual-TODO list. Use `gh pr create --body-file` so multi-
    line content survives shell escaping.

11. **Surface the TODO list** to the user in the conversation. Group by
    category (`[bootstrap]`, `[fingerprint]`, `[transfers]`, etc.) so the
    user can decide quickly which to address before merging vs which can
    wait. Don't merge for the user — they review and click Squash & merge.

## Manual TODOs to expect

The orchestrator's `manualTodos[]` is the most important output. Categories:

- **`[bootstrap]`** — state-metadata.json doesn't have curated entries for
  the state's full name / system name / senior-waiver citation. The
  bootstrap proceeds with placeholder values; the user fills in the right
  values before merging. Always present for a never-before-added state.

- **`[fingerprint]`** — colleges whose SIS platform isn't in the
  banner-ssb-9 / colleague / banner-8 trio. Specifics:
  - `custom HTML/SPA` — bespoke scraper needed; out of scope for this skill
  - `auth-gated` — SSO-only; can't scrape without credentials; user accepts
    the gap or contacts the college
  - `jenzabar` / `peoplesoft` / `workday` / etc. — known platforms with no
    template yet; future PR could add one
  - `acalog` / `courseleaf` — programs/catalog platforms, not course-search;
    irrelevant for Phase 2
  - `unknown` — no SIS detected; usually means the homepage doesn't link
    to the registration system on a discoverable nav path. Manual lookup.

- **`[transfers]`** — state has no entry in `data/articulation-portals.json`.
  Fallback to CollegeTransfer.Net is suggested but requires per-college
  SourceInstitutionIds (one-time research per college). Or the user adds a
  registry entry once they identify the state's articulation portal.

- **`[prereqs]`** — aggregation failed. Usually means Phase 2 produced no
  data (every college had a custom platform). Re-run after Phase 2 issues
  are resolved.

## Failure modes

- **Bootstrap fails** (IPEDS API down, FIPS wrong, etc.): abort; tell the
  user to retry. No partial commit, no branch left behind.
  ```
  git checkout main && git branch -D claude/{slug}-auto-add-state
  ```

- **Bootstrap succeeds, every later phase fails**: commit Phase 1 only;
  open the PR with a clear "Phases 2–4 deferred" note. User merges Phase 1
  to unblock the registry, then runs the orchestrator again with
  `--skip-bootstrap` to retry the rest.

- **Some scraper cohort fails (e.g. Banner SSB) but Colleague succeeds**:
  the orchestrator records the failure in `manualTodos`; commit the data
  that did land. PR body explicitly lists which cohorts ran clean.

- **Pre-PR feature check shows empty `/colleges` grid**: don't commit.
  Means the registry edits got applied to the wrong place. Manually
  inspect `lib/institutions.ts`, `lib/geo.ts`, `lib/states/registry.ts`
  for the new state's import + entry. If the registry-edit regex
  appended to the wrong section, fix manually and re-run from step 7.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Refactor any existing scraper (additive-only invariant)
- Import scraped data to Supabase directly (the existing
  `import-on-merge.yml` workflow handles that when the PR lands)
- Phase 5 (programs) — left as a manual follow-up
- Custom-platform scrapers — flagged as TODOs, not built

## Adding new platform support later

If, after using this skill, you find that 5+ states keep flagging the
same untemplated platform (Jenzabar, Workday, etc.), that's the signal
to add a new template under `scripts/lib/scrape-{platform}.ts`, register
it in `add-state.ts`'s `TEMPLATED_COURSE_PLATFORMS` array, and ship as
its own PR (same shape as PRs 2–4 of this series).

## After-merge follow-ups (for the user, not the skill)

After the PR merges and Vercel redeploys (~3 minutes):
- Verify `/{slug}/colleges` renders all colleges on prod
- Verify `/{slug}` zip-code search returns at least one college
- Watch the Vercel build for any "statement_timeout" errors on
  `/colleges/page` — see `add-new-state` skill for the SQL fix

The TODO items in the PR body are the user's review checklist. Most can
be deferred (the state is functional without senior-waiver curation),
but a few (custom-portal colleges with high enrollment) are worth
addressing before the state launches publicly.
