# Community College Path

A national community college course navigator. Helps students find classes, plan schedules, and understand transfer equivalencies across public community-college systems.

- **Live site:** communitycollegepath.com (Vercel project: `cc-coursemap`)
- **Brand name in user-facing copy:** "Community College Path" — not "CC CourseMap", not "AuditMap". The folder name `cc-coursemap` is legacy.
- **North star:** a first-generation student with no prior college experience should be able to use the site without help.

## Scope

The project is **national, expanding state-by-state**. East Coast is nearly complete. Never treat this as a Virginia-only tool — VA was the original scope but the architecture is multi-state.

Currently covered states (as of this writing): ct, dc, de, ga, ma, md, me, nc, nh, nj, ny, pa, ri, sc, tn, va, vt. Run `getAllStates()` for the authoritative list.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript · Supabase (Postgres + SSR auth) · Tailwind v4 · Playwright + cheerio for scrapers · Resend for transactional email · Vercel hosting.

## Architectural invariants — do not violate

1. **Never hardcode state lists.** Derive from the registry via `getAllStates()` / `getStateConfig(slug)`. Commit `be494a7` removed every hardcoded state list specifically to make new-state expansion a config-only change. Components that need per-state values accept them as props; they do not import a `PLACEHOLDER_BY_STATE`-style map.
2. **State-specific defaults live in `StateConfig`.** Zip placeholders, senior-waiver citations, SIS URLs, `defaultZip`, `defaultZipCity`, etc. Never write ternary chains like `state === 'va' ? X : Y` in components.
3. **Per-state file layout is fixed.** Data in `data/{state}/`, scrapers in `scripts/{state}/`, config in `lib/states/{state}/config.ts`. Dynamic routing through `app/[state]/…`.
4. **Student data never runs through prod with fake values.** If a scraper fails, leave the existing data untouched rather than substitute placeholder courses.

## Environment variables

Source of truth: `.env.example` in repo root. Local dev uses `.env.local` (gitignored). Vercel holds the production values.

## Dev commands

- `npm run dev` — local Next server
- `npm run build` · `npm run lint`
- `npm run scrape:college -- <slug>` — scrape a single VA college (VCCS)
- `npm run enrich:college -- <slug>` — PeopleSoft enrichment for one VA college
- Per-state scrapers live at `scripts/{state}/…` — invoke directly with `tsx`

## Adding a new state

This is the most frequent multi-step workflow. See the `add-new-state` skill (`.claude/skills/add-new-state/`). Short version: bootstrap (data + config + registry) → course scraper → transfer data → prereqs → Supabase import. Each phase is its own PR.

## Git — narrate as you go

The user is learning git in real time and wants to understand what's happening, not just approve blind steps. When running any git or `gh` command, narrate it in **one or two plain-English sentences** before or after the tool call:

- What the command does ("create a new branch off main" / "push this branch to GitHub" / "open a pull request")
- What state the repo is in after ("you now have 1 commit not yet on main" / "the branch is on GitHub but not merged yet")
- What the next step looks like and who does it ("now you click Merge on GitHub" / "I'll wait for you to confirm the PR is merged before starting the next branch")

Avoid jargon unless you define it inline. Say "squash and merge = collapse the branch's commits into one, then land it on main" the first time, not just "squash". If the user has already been told a concept this session, don't re-explain — just use it.

Branch naming convention used so far: `claude/<state>-phase<N><letter>-<topic>` (e.g. `claude/ma-phase2b-colleague`). Stick to that so the user sees a consistent pattern.

Merging is the user's job — they click "Squash and merge" on GitHub. Don't run `gh pr merge` on their behalf unless they explicitly ask.

## Verifying your work — three checks, in order

Typecheck passing and a scraper completing without errors are necessary but not sufficient. Data can be wrong, APIs can return the right shape with broken content, and a PR that looks fine in isolation can break the UI for real users. Do these three, every time:

### 1. Pre-PR feature check ("does the feature I just shipped actually work?")
Before opening a PR that ships new data or a new endpoint, load the matching feature in local dev and exercise it end-to-end. Don't just hit the API — click through the UI the way the feature will be used:

- New course data for a state → load `/{state}` and search for a course; confirm sections render with the expected fields.
- New transfer data → load `/{state}/transfer`, pick a sending CC and a course, confirm the equivalency shows up.
- New prereq data → load the semester planner, type a course that you know has a prereq, confirm the prereq chain resolves.
- A bug fix → reproduce the bug path and confirm it's fixed.

Cost: usually under 5 minutes. Catches: "the JSON parsed but the field names don't match what the UI reads."

### 2. Post-merge prod check ("did Vercel actually ship it?")
After merging a PR, wait ~2-3 minutes for Vercel to redeploy, then load prod and verify one concrete thing changed:

- `curl communitycollegepath.com/api/{state}/…` returns the new data.
- The visible symptom that motivated the PR (empty page, missing state card, 404) is gone.

Cost: one minute. Catches: missing registry entries, static-import gaps (see the NH/MA `/colleges` bug), Vercel build failures, environment variable drift. Silence here looks identical to success — so always pick a specific thing to verify, not just "it looks fine."

### 3. Student-perspective walkthrough at major milestones
After a whole state lands, or after a user-facing feature ships, use the site the way a first-gen student with no prior college experience would. Example scope:

> "I live in 02108, want a weekend accounting class, need to know if it transfers to UMass Boston."

Walk through the full flow. If any step confuses you, it'll confuse a real student. This is where empty states, missing copy, broken filter combos, and data shape mismatches across features reveal themselves.

Cost: 5-10 minutes. Catches: the things the other two checks miss — interaction bugs, UX cliffs, cross-feature inconsistencies.

## Environment quirks

**This is NOT the Next.js you know.** Next 16 has breaking changes vs. training-data-era Next.js. Before writing routing, caching, or server-component code, read the relevant page in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Heed deprecation notices.
